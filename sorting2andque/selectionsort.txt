Selection sort algorithm
// Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part. The process continues until the entire list is sorted.

steps
// 5 3 2 1 4
// first pass:
find the least element in the array
// 1 is the least element, swap it with the first element   
// 1 3 2 5 4
// second pass:
find the least element in the remaining array (3 2 5 4)
// 2 is the least element, swap it with the first element of the remaining array  
// 1 2 3 5 4
// third pass:
find the least element in the remaining array (3 5 4)
// 3 is the least element, no swap needed
// 1 2 3 5 4
// fourth pass:
find the least element in the remaining array (5 4)
// 4 is the least element, swap it with the first element of the remaining array
// 1 2 3 4 5
// fifth pass:
// only one element left, no swap needed
// 1 2 3 4 5

// observations:
// 1. The algorithm is not efficient for large datasets.
// 2. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.
// 3. Space complexity is O(1) since it only requires a constant amount of additional space.
// 4. It is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional storage for sorting.
// 5. Selection sort is not a stable sort, as it may change the relative order of equal elements.
