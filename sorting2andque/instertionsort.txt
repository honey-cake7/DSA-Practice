Insertion sort
// Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time. It works by taking an element from the unsorted part of the array and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part of the array. The process continues until the entire array is sorted.

steps
// 5 3 2 1 4
// first pass:
// take the first element (5) and insert it into the sorted part (which is empty)
// // 5 3 2 1 4
// second pass:
// take the second element (3) and insert it into the sorted part (5)
// // 3 is less than 5, so we shift 5 to the right and insert 3 at the beginning
// // 3 5 2 1 4
// third pass:
// take the third element (2) and insert it into the sorted part (3 5)
// // 2 is less than 3, so we shift 3 and 5 to the right and insert 2 at the beginning
// // 2 3 5 1 4
// fourth pass:
// take the fourth element (1) and insert it into the sorted part (2 3 5)
// // 1 is less than 2, so we shift 2, 3, and 5 to the right and insert 1 at the beginning
// // 1 2 3 5 4 
// fifth pass:
// take the fifth element (4) and insert it into the sorted part (1 2 3 5)  
// // 4 is less than 5, so we shift 5 to the right and insert 4 before it
// // 1 2 3 4 5
// observations:
// 1. The algorithm is efficient for small datasets.
// 2. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, but O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
// 3. Space complexity is O(1) since it only requires a constant amount of additional space.
// 4. It is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional storage for sorting.
// 5. Insertion sort is a stable sort, as it maintains the relative order of equal elements.
