Merge sort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm for sorting an array or list of elements. It works by recursively splitting the array into halves until each sub-array contains a single element, and then merging those sub-arrays back together in sorted order.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst).
Space Complexity: O(n) due to the temporary arrays used for merging.
stable: Yes, merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
Disadvantages: Merge sort requires additional space for the temporary arrays, which can be a drawback for large datasets. It is also not an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it cannot sort the array without using additional memory.
